### WARNINGS:
* ALWAYS connect the Low Voltage Buzzer to the lipo, **while driving** to get audio feedback, when to change the lipos
* ALWAYS disconnect the Lipo after you're **done driving** the car. Also disconnect the Low Voltage Buzzer as it consumes energy aswell. Otherwise the lipo will be discharged for days. If the Lipo is deeply discharged, it will get puffy and damaged permanently. If the lipo is visibly swollen, you should not charge it anymore!
