# 1. NVIDIA Jetson Part
![alt text](https://github.com/AdrianGehrig/Project-Autonomous-Car/blob/master/Documentation/OpenCV_ideal2.png "CVgood")
### WARNINGS:
* ALWAYS connect the Low Voltage Buzzer to the lipo, **while driving** to get audio feedback, when to change the lipos
* ALWAYS disconnect the Lipo after you're **done driving** the car. Also disconnect the Low Voltage Buzzer as it consumes energy aswell. Otherwise the lipo will be discharged for days. If the Lipo is deeply discharged, it will get puffy and damaged permanently. If the lipo is visibly swollen, you should not charge it anymore! 
* ALWAYS keep the transmitter in your hands, to disable the autonomous mode at any moment. By touching the steering wheel or the accellerator, the car will initiate an emergency break for one second. After this break the car returns to manual mode.


## 1.1 Normal starting procedure
_If nothing has changed and the current state is still as we left it in SS18 this will work:_

1. Boot the Jetson [Red Power Button] and login with Username: Nvidia, PW: nvidia
2. Open the explorer and navigate into the "PlanA" directory. All the files listed in the GitHub subfolder "PlanA_ComputerVision" should still be on the Jetson. If not, download them from this GitHub repository.
3. Open a Command promt window by right clicking and selecting "start command window here" in the explorer.
4. Type in **python main.py** and hit enter...the GUI should start.

   If the console shows some kind of "streamer Error" you need to unplug and replug the USB camera.


   If the GUI doesn't show up, open the main.py file in the editor and search for "OPTIMIERUNG_EINGESCHALTET = True"
set it to "OPTIMIERUNG_EINGESCHALTET = False" , save the file and retry.

5. Start the autonomous mode by pressing [9] on the keyboard (Even works though SSH connection) or the blue button on the STM32F4 Board, located on the back of the car.
6. Leave the autonomous mode by pressing pressing [9] on the keyboard or by touching the steering wheel or the accellerator on the transmitter.

7. Have fun!

## 1.2 Overview of the files
### 1.2.1 [KommunikationUart.py]
This file is responsible for the UART communication between the Jetson and the STM32F4 Board. It is used in the **main.py** as an interface to the STM32F4 board.

It consists of a configuration part, where some settings are made to that the Jetson side is configured right.

A sending part, that is able to send 4 floats and 16 seperate bits. There are some reserves left for further upgrades.

A reading part, that is able to receive 8 floats and 16 seperate bits. There are some reserves left for further upgrades.

### 1.2.2 [KommunikationUart.pyc]
Just a cache file, that is automatically generated by KommunikationUart.py

### 1.2.3 [WebcamVideoStream.py]
A file, that is not used, it just shows, how the library works...this file must be hidden somewhere in the library installation folder aswell and used from there..

### 1.2.4 [dist.dat]
Generated form  **distortion.py**

### 1.2.5 [distortion.py]
This file must be ran, if a new camera setup is used. Use a checkerboard to take photos with the new camera from different angles. It then calculates the diffraction of the lens and saves the data in **dist.dat** this information is used in **main.py** when reading a frame.

### 1.2.6 [frame.jpg]
Generated by **grabFrameAsJpg.py.**

### 1.2.7 [grabFrameAsJpg.py]
Takes a snapshot of the current camera image and saves it as **frame.jpg** , which is needed in **transformaiton_handler.py.**

### 1.2.8 [img_size.dat]
Generated by ? ...I think it's not needed

### 1.2.9 [main.py]
The main programm. Consists of functions for reading and processing the image, showing a GUI, sending and receiving data to and from the STM32F4.

A main loop is executed at the very bottom, that calls all functions periodically

For ideal performance change "line 9" from "OPTIMIERUNG_EINGESCHALTET = False" --to--> "OPTIMIERUNG_EINGESCHALTET = True" ...some loops will be deactivated and the GUI aswell. This decreases the cicle time, thus increasing the reaction time of the system.

### 1.2.10 [mtx.dat]
Generated form  **distortion.py**

### 1.2.11 [th.py]
Call this file, to show the real fps of the used camera

### 1.2.12 [trans_M.dat]
Generated by **transformation_handler.py**

### 1.2.13 [trans_inv_M.dat]
Generated by **transformation_handler.py**

### 1.2.14 [transformation_handler.py]
Call this file, if the camera angle has changed, in order to recalibrate the transformation into bird's eye view.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Take a snapshot with **grabFrameAsJpg.py**
2. Run **transformation_handler.py**
3. Select a trapeze, that will be warped to the destination points configured in **transformation_handler.py** by starting to klick bottom left point, top left , top right, bottom right.
4. After the fourth point was selected, the program will close and save the settings **in trans_M.dat** and **trans_inv_M.dat**

# 2. STM32 F4 Part (Identical in PlanA and PlanB)
The microcontroller is programmed in Simulink. The C code for the microcontroller is generated and downloaded with the click of a button! Waijung is a very handy library, that has some prebuilt blocks for acessing the microcontrollers hardware. E.g. a block for sending PWM signals or communicating via UART. 

For further instructions on istallation, Getting Started, Tips and Tricks please read:

["Matlab zu Discovery Board.docx" in the documentation path](https://github.com/AdrianGehrig/Project-Autonomous-Car/blob/master/Documentation/Matlab%20zu%20Discovery%20Board.docx "Word Document")

## 2.1 Overview
After correctly installed the drivers and the Waijung package, open **STDiscovery2016a.slx** in Simulink.

Simulink is a graphical programming lauguage, individual program parts can be organized in subsystems. Waijung blocks for reading data are located on the left side. For processing the data, the infromation is carried via black arrows from one block to another. Logical or calculating operations are done in the middle section. Finally the Waijung output blocks are located on the right side.

![alt text](https://github.com/AdrianGehrig/Project-Autonomous-Car/blob/master/Documentation/Waijung%20overview.PNG)



### (1) Global Variables
They are read/writable in every subsystem underneath. They are used multiple times and some will be predifined once in **(6).**

An alternative way would be to run a matlab script in **(6)** , were all the variables would be declaired and some predefined.

### (6) Initialisation
Some global Variables are predefined here

### (2) Waijung Initialisation Block
This block needs to be in the top layer, when Waijung blocks are used

### (3) Reading actual velocity
A hall sensor is processed here and the velocity is calculated. This variable will be sent back to the Jetson, and displayed in the GUI

### (4) Actuators
motor and servo logic is located in this subsystem. Also the safety feature for disabling the autonomous mode, when touching the steering wheel or the accelerator on the Transmitter is found here.

At the moment two bits are send to the STM32F4 over UART, "Computer Vision Mode" and "Neural Net Mode". These bits enable or disable a certain feature in the Simulink Program...This can be confusing. In a future version, the microcontroller should only get a single steering and velocity command over UART (2x float) for better readability.

### (5) Communication
The Data, that is read in via the Waijung UART blocks will be wirtten to global receiving variables.
The global sending variables will be send via the Waijung UART blocks to the Jetson. 

### (7) Status LEDs
The Status LED pattern for the autonomous and manual mode is generated here.

### (8) Power Distribution Unit
Not implemented yet. The idea was to read the current consumption of some FETs an disable them, if the consumption reaches a certain limit

### (9) Debug
This subsystem is used when debugging the microcontroller over an FDTI connection. An FDTI Adapter or an Arduino (["as seen here on ther very bottom here"](https://github.com/AdrianGehrig/Project-Autonomous-Car/blob/master/Documentation/Matlab%20zu%20Discovery%20Board.docx "Word Document")) can be used for that.
Some Varaibles can be sent back for debugging to a PC. Or an event can be triggered, when sending a certain Ascii caracter from the PC to the STM32F4.


### (10) Build Model
Connect the Microcontroller to the PC via USB.
Press this button to compile the the Simulink program to C code and download it to the STM32F4.

## 2.2 Some hints
* Do not use "äöü" or any fancy symbols underneath Waijung blocks...the compiler just throws a cryptic error message and won't compile
* Do not use hardware ports multiple times in Waijung blocks, always keep an eye on your used ports, like(["this visio drawing"](https://github.com/AdrianGehrig/Project-Autonomous-Car/blob/master/Documentation/ST_Pinout_und_Anschl%C3%BCsse.pdf))
* Some ports are selectable in Waijung for certain features, but the hardware does not support it. The compiler just won't compile, but the error message is misleading and cryptic.
