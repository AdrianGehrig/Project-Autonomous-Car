# Project Autonomous Car
_This is a student project. Me and two other students built and wrote software for a self driving rc car._



## Plan A,  (Computer Vision)




## Plan B,  (Artificial Neural Net)
_This approach is heavily inspired by:_ 
* _["How to Simulate a Self-Driving Car
" from Siraj Raval]()_
* _["End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" NVIDIA from NVIDIA](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)_
